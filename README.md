Final creative project for CSE438. Robust chess app from scratch. Doesn't account for rules of stalemate, castling out of check, en passant capture for pawns, and pawn promotion. Otherwise, it is a fully functional chess game that doesn't allow any illegal moves and assesses checkmate correctly for every situation I've tested.
